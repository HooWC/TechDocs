React Native is an open source framework developed by Facebook for building cross-platform mobile applications. It allows developers to develop native applications using JavaScript and React, making it more efficient to build applications for iOS and Android. Since its first release in 2015, React Native has quickly become an important tool for mobile application development and has been widely welcomed by developers and enterprises.

The core concept of React Native is "write once, run on multiple platforms". By using the componentization idea of React, developers can split the user interface into reusable components, thereby improving the reusability and maintainability of the code. Compared with traditional web development, React Native provides a user experience closer to native applications because it directly uses native components for rendering instead of relying on WebView.

An important feature is hot reloading, which allows developers to see changes immediately after modifying the code without reloading the entire application. This fast feedback loop significantly improves development efficiency and makes debugging and iteration more convenient. In addition, React Native also supports integration with native modules. Developers can use Swift, Java, or Objective-C to write native code to expand functionality or improve performance when necessary.

React Native has an active community and a large number of third-party libraries. Developers can easily find ready-made components and tools to shorten the development cycle. At the same time, well-known companies such as Facebook, Instagram, and Uber Eats also choose to use React Native to develop their mobile applications, proving its feasibility and stability in production environments.
