jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax interactions. It was created by John Resig in 2006 and has become one of the most popular libraries in front-end development over the years.

jQuery's main goal is to make JavaScript programming easier and more efficient. It enables developers to more easily perform DOM operations by providing a concise API, thereby changing the content and structure of a web page. With jQuery, developers can quickly select HTML elements through simple selector syntax and operate on them, such as modifying text, style, adding or removing elements, etc.

A notable feature is jQuery's cross-browser compatibility. In the early days of web development, different browsers had different implementations of JavaScript, which made it challenging for developers to handle events and DOM operations. jQuery encapsulates these differences so that developers can write code once without worrying about performance in different browsers.

jQuery also provides a powerful event handling mechanism that allows developers to easily bind and handle user interaction events such as clicks, input, and mouse movements. By chaining calls, jQuery allows multiple operations to be performed sequentially in the same line of code, thereby improving the readability and maintainability of the code.

In terms of Ajax, jQuery provides a series of methods that simplify asynchronous communication with the server. Developers can easily send HTTP requests, receive responses, and update page content without reloading the entire page. This feature makes it possible to build dynamic and interactive web applications.

Although modern JavaScript and frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.js have narrowed the gap with jQuery in many aspects, jQuery is still widely used in many projects and old code. Due to its simplicity and powerful functions, jQuery is still an important tool for beginners to learn front-end development, and it also plays an important role in the development of complex web applications. As front-end technology continues to evolve, jQuery is still a basic skill worth mastering.
