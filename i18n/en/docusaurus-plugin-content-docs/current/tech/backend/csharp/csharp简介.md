C# (pronounced "C Sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language introduced by Microsoft in 2000. C# is one of the core languages ​​of the .NET platform and is designed to provide a simple, modern, and efficient programming experience. Its design is inspired by C, C++, and Java, with strong type safety, memory management, and cross-platform capabilities.

C# is mainly used to develop Windows applications, web applications (through ASP.NET), game development (using the Unity engine), and mobile applications (through Xamarin). It supports object-oriented programming features, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making it easier to organize and reuse code.

C# has a rich class library and framework that supports advanced features such as asynchronous programming, LINQ (Language Integrated Query), and Lambda expressions. These features enable developers to process data and build complex applications quickly and efficiently. C# also supports multithreading and concurrent programming, making it easier to develop high-performance applications.

With the launch of .NET Core, C#'s cross-platform capabilities have been greatly enhanced, and developers can run C# applications on different operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and macOS. Due to its simplicity, flexibility, and powerful ecosystem, C# has become the preferred language for many developers and is widely used in enterprise applications, game development, cloud computing, and other fields.
