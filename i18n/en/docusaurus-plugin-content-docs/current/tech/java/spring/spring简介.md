Spring MVC is a module based on the Spring framework, specifically for building Web applications. It adopts the classic MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern and provides a flexible and efficient way to develop Java Web applications. Spring MVC separates business logic, user interface, and request processing, making the application structure clearer, easier to maintain and expand.

The main features of Spring MVC include:

1. **Flexible configuration**: Spring MVC supports configuration through XML configuration and annotations, and developers can choose the appropriate method according to their needs. Spring's dependency injection feature makes it easier to configure and manage components.
2. **Powerful request mapping**: Spring MVC provides flexible URL routing and request mapping functions, allowing developers to define how HTTP requests are handled. By using annotations (such as `@RequestMapping`), URLs can be easily mapped to corresponding controller methods.
3. **Support for multiple view parsing**: Spring MVC supports multiple view technologies, such as JSP, Thymeleaf, FreeMarker, and PDF. Developers can choose the appropriate view technology according to project requirements, so as to flexibly handle the user interface.
4. **Integrate RESTful API**: Spring MVC is also very suitable for building RESTful APIs, supporting data exchange in JSON and XML formats. By using the `@RestController` annotation, the creation of RESTful services can be simplified.
5. **Data binding and validation**: Spring MVC provides powerful data binding and validation functions. Developers can easily bind request parameters to Java objects and perform validation and error handling.
6. **Support internationalization and multi-language**: Spring MVC supports internationalization functions, allowing developers to easily build multi-language applications. By configuring resource files, different content can be provided according to the user's region and language.
