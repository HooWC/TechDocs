Java Dynamic Web Project is a web application development model based on Java EE (Java Platform, Enterprise Edition). It allows developers to build web applications that dynamically generate content, usually in combination with server-side technologies such as Java Servlets and JSP. This project structure is often used to create websites that respond to user requests and display content dynamically.

The main features of Java Dynamic Web Project include:

1. **Dynamic content generation**: Unlike static web pages, Dynamic Web Project can dynamically generate content based on user requests and data changes. It uses server-side programming technologies such as Java Servlets and JSP to process requests and return responses.
2. **Using Servlet and JSP**: Java Servlet is a Java class running on the server that is responsible for processing requests and generating responses. JSP (JavaServer Pages) is an HTML page with Java code embedded in it, allowing developers to easily generate dynamic content. The two are often used in combination to implement complex web application logic.
3. **MVC pattern support**: Dynamic Web Project can usually use the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern to implement the layered structure of the application. By separating business logic (Model), user interface (View), and request processing (Controller), developers can improve the maintainability and scalability of the code.
4. **Integration with the Java EE ecosystem**: Java Dynamic Web Project can leverage other components of Java EE, such as Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), Java Persistence API (JPA), and Java Message Service (JMS), to build complex enterprise-level applications.
5. **Multiple development tool support**: Developers can use a variety of IDEs (integrated development environments) to create Java Dynamic Web Projects, such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and NetBeans. These tools usually provide rich plug-ins and features to simplify the development process.
