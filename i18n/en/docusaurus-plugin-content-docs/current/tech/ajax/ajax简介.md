Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technology for creating fast and dynamic web applications. Ajax allows asynchronous communication with the server through JavaScript without reloading the entire page, thereby improving the user experience. Although Ajax contains XML in its name, it can actually communicate using a variety of data formats, including JSON, HTML, and plain text.

The core features of Ajax include:

1. **Asynchronous interaction**: Through Ajax, web pages can exchange data with the server in the background without refreshing the page. This asynchronous feature allows users to use the application without interruption, thereby improving the user experience.
2. **Fast response**: By requesting and updating only the required data, Ajax can significantly reduce the amount of data transferred and page loading time. This allows the application to respond quickly to user operations and provide smoother interactions.
3. **Support for multiple data formats**: Although Ajax originally usually used XML format to transmit data, JSON format is now more commonly used because JSON is lighter, easier to parse, and more compatible with JavaScript.
4. **Compatibility**: Modern browsers support Ajax technology, and developers can use Ajax to create rich user experiences on various platforms and devices.
5. **Integration with RESTful API**: Ajax is often used to interact with RESTful APIs, allowing clients to easily request and submit data from the server. By using Ajax, developers can build dynamic single-page applications (SPAs) and mobile applications.
6. **Improve application performance**: By requesting and updating only necessary data, Ajax can significantly improve the performance of web applications, reduce server load, and provide faster responses.
