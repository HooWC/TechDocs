### Method 1: Find the password world in "Settings"

Don't worry, the steps are super simple, just follow me!

#### Steps:

1. **Summon the "Settings" ambassador**
Use the shortcut key `Win + I` to summon "Settings" - if your hand speed is fast enough, it will pop up instantly!

2. **Turn to the "Account" area**
After entering, select "Account". This is your base camp for managing passwords.

3. **Go to "Login Options"**
Find "Login Options" in the menu on the left! There are not many options, so don't be afraid of clicking the wrong one.

4. **Find "Password" and click "Change"**
Do you see "Password"? Click that "Change"! Don't worry, you won't get an electric shock.
5. **Verify your identity (yes, you are the owner!)**
The system will doubt whether you are yourself (funny, right?), so you need to enter the old password to prove your identity first.
6. **Enter the new password and leave yourself a hint**
Again! Enter a resounding new password. Then leave a password hint to prevent yourself from getting confused.
7. **Press the "Finish" button and the password is done! **
Hey! It's done, and you immediately become the legal owner of the new password!

### Method 2: Use the old-fashioned password change method through the "Control Panel"

Do you think the control panel is outdated? Then you underestimate it! It is an ancient password management god!

#### Steps:

1. **Summon the old antique "Control Panel"**
Open the "Start" menu and search for "Control Panel" to let its dusty screen see the light of day again.
2. **Select "User Accounts", this is your position**
After entering, find "User Accounts"! This name is quite domineering, right?
3. **Click "User Account" again**
Yes, you have to click it again, be patient, the control panel has its own temper.
4. **Click "Change Account Password"**
Select the account whose password you want to change (usually the one you are currently logged in), and click "Change Password".
5. **Give an old password and a new password**
Just like recognizing your relatives, enter your old password and then a new password to be the successor!
6. **Click "Change Password" and you're done! **
Click the "Change Password" button again, and you're done. The old-fashioned way is really stable!

### Method 3: For big guys only - change passwords in the command prompt

This is suitable for computer big guys, especially those who like to type code. Please call it the command line method!

#### Steps:

1. **Call out the command prompt**
Search for "cmd" in "Start", right-click after finding it, and select "Run as administrator" - a must-have for big guys.

2. **Enter the secret code**
Enter this mysterious command in the command prompt:

```shell
net user username new password
```

For example, if the username is `admin` and the new password is `P@ssw0rd123`, then enter:

```shell
net user admin P@ssw0rd123
```

3. **Press Enter**
Do not doubt it, press `Enter`, if "Command completed successfully" pops up, it means the password has been changed successfully, and it is done easily!

### Tips: The password should also be "fashionable"

- **Strong passwords are more secure**: Think about whether you will be cracked in 100 years? So add more symbols and numbers, and be more fashionable!

- **Password hints should be reliable**: Write the hints casually, don't write them like detective novel riddles, your future self may not understand them.
- **Don't make it too simple**: Forget about 123456, it's too simple and someone can crack it with just a glance!

OK! Try these three methods, there will always be one that suits you. Change your password, protect your data with peace of mind, and have a cup of coffee!
