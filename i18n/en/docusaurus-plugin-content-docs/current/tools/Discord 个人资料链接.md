### How to Copy Your Discord Personal Link


:::success Reminder

Discord is one of the most popular chat platforms out there, whether it's for games, communities, study groups, or work teams. Discord provides a variety of functions to help users communicate and manage communities, among which personal links are one of the practical functions. While Discord's interface is intuitive, it doesn't offer the ability to copy personal links as prominently as other social media platforms. This article details how to find and copy your own personal link in Discord.

#### 1. What is a Discord personal link?
A Discord personal link is a unique URL that directs others to your profile page. For example, the format is:

```
https://discordapp.com/users/個人ID
```

Where ``Personal ID`` is your Discord user ID, the link can be used to quickly share your account information, such as allowing others to add friends or view your profile directly.

#### 2. why do I need a personal link?
Discord doesn't find users by username or other simple searches like other social platforms, so personal links are especially useful in the following situations:
1. **Quickly add friends**: Through links, other users can directly access your profile and send friend requests without having to search for usernames.
2. **Share profile**: sharing a personal link is a convenient way for users who want to showcase their Discord account (e.g. content creators, community administrators, etc.).
3. **Use on external platforms**: If you want to publicize Discord contact information on external platforms (e.g., personal websites, social media), providing a personal link is an effective way to do so.

#### 3. How to find and copy your Discord User ID
In Discord, a User ID is a unique numeric identifier that is used to recognize each User on the Platform. Here's how to get your own User ID:
1. **Enable Developer Mode**:
   - In the Discord app, tap the Settings icon in the lower-left corner to go to User Settings.
   - In the Settings menu, scroll down to find the “Advanced” option.
   - Tap into the Advanced settings, find the Developer Mode option and turn it on.
   - With Developer Mode enabled, you can right-click on any username or message in Discord to retrieve information, including the user ID. 2.
2. **Get your User ID**:
   - Return to the main screen and go to any server or direct message window you are participating in.
   - Find your username in the list of users on the left, or find your name in the upper right corner of the private message window.
   - Right click on your username and you will see an option called “Copy ID”.
   - Click on “Copy ID” and your user ID is now copied to the clipboard and can be pasted directly into any text box for use.

#### 4. Generate and Copy Your Personal Link
After getting your User ID, you can create a personal link. The format is:
```
https://discordapp.com/users/youID
```
Assuming your user ID is `123456789012345678`, then your personal link is:
```
https://discordapp.com/users/123456789012345678
```
You can send this link to other users or post it on social media so that others can view your Discord profile or send friend requests through this link.

#### 5. How to confirm whether the personal link is valid or not
Once you have completed your personal link, it is recommended that you open the link in your browser to ensure its validity. You can confirm whether the link is correct by following the steps below:
1. **Open Browser**: Open a new tab in any browser (e.g. Chrome, Firefox).
2. **Paste the link**: Paste the generated personal link (e.g. `https://discordapp.com/users/123456789012345678`) in the address bar and press enter.
3. **Check the result**: If the link is correct, you will see your profile page; if it is wrong, you need to make sure the ID is correct or check if the link format is wrong.

#### 6. Adding friends through personal links
Other users can quickly send you a friend request through your personal link. Here are the actions they can perform when they see your profile:
1. **View Basic Information**: Users can see your username, avatar, and personal status.
2. **Send Friend Request**: On your profile page, there is an “Add Friend” button, which can be clicked to send a friend request directly to you. 3.
3. **Send Message**: If you are on the same server or are already a friend, other users can also send you a message directly through this page.

#### 7. Protecting Privacy and Security
While personal links make it easier for others to find you, they may also pose some privacy and security concerns. Here are some precautions to take to ensure your privacy and security:
1. **Who to share the link**: Share your personal link only to trusted users or communities to avoid misuse of the link by unknown users.
2. **Adjust privacy settings**: In Discord settings you can adjust privacy options such as whether to allow strangers to send friend requests.
3. **Use nicknames instead of your real name**: Use nicknames in your profile that are not related to your real name to minimize the risk of privacy leaks.

#### 8. Frequently Asked Questions
**1. Does the ID change every time I log in? **.
No. Discord user IDs are unique and do not change when you log back in or change your username. Even if you change your username, your User ID remains the same, so your personal links are not affected.
**2. Why can't my friends add me through a link? **.
If you are having problems with people adding you via the link, it may be due to one of the following reasons:
- **Privacy settings**: Check your privacy settings to make sure you allow others to send friend requests.
- **ID input error**: Make sure the user ID in the link is correct, we recommend copying and generating the link again.
- **Network problem**: Some network environments may be restricting access to Discord, check for network restrictions.
