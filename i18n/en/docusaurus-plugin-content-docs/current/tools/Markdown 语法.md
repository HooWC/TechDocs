`:::success` is a Markdown syntax used to create tooltips with different colors. This syntax is often used in documents to provide different information types, such as success, warning, information, etc.

Here are a few common examples:

1. **Success prompt box**：

   ```markdown
   :::success
   This is a successful tip!
   :::
   ```

2. **Warning prompt box**：

   ```markdown
   :::warning
   Be careful! Something might go wrong!
   :::
   ```

3. **Information prompt box**：

   ```markdown
   :::info
   This is a general informational prompt.
   :::
   ```

4. **Error message box**：

   ```markdown
   :::error
   Oops! Something went wrong!
   :::
   ```

Different Markdown renderers or platforms (such as GitHub, GitLab, MkDocs, etc.) may display tooltips in different colors based on these tags. Generally speaking, `success` is green, `warning` is yellow, `info` is blue, and `error` is red.
