Page loading slowly? Don't panic! Let's "slim down" and make it fly!

:::

### Have you ever had this experience?

Every time you open a website, the waiting time is longer than when you wait for takeout? You obviously want to check a page quickly, but you are tortured by the loading animation and the progress bar that crawls as slowly as a snail. Are you cursing in your heart: "Why is this website so slow? Are you trying to give me a challenge of "loading patience"?"üò±

Every time you open a page and face the "endless loading" screen, have you ever thought: **"This is the 21st century, is the web page loading going to be as crowded as the subway rush hour?"**

**Calm down! ** You are not alone - every developer has experienced this "slow loading" trouble. But don't be afraid! Today we will tell you how to make your web page load as fast as a sports car and avoid the embarrassment of slow page loading! üöÄ

### Reasons for slow page loading - the culprits behind the scenes are revealed!

First, let's take a look at the major culprits behind slow page loading - they are the "culprits" causing slow page loading:

1. **The image is too big! **
Did you know? A high-definition image may occupy several megabytes or even tens of megabytes in size, and loading it is like looking for water in the desert! It's like you brought the entire dinner party into the car and tried to fit a banquet hall in your sedan, which is impossible.
2. **CSS and JavaScript files are too large! **
Yes, web designers and developers like to add all kinds of cool effects and functions to web pages, but if these files are not optimized, the page loading speed will become a mess. Imagine that every plug-in and every special effect is like putting a thick down jacket on the web page - it's hot, but can you stand it stuffing you up?
3. **Load unnecessary resources! **
There are always some "useless" resources on the website that don't need to be loaded at all, but they are just there quietly waiting, taking up your bandwidth and server resources. It's like you fill up your shopping cart and walk into the supermarket with some things you don't need at all - wasting space and time.

### So how to solve these problems?

Don't be afraid, the developer is here to bring you a "weight loss plan"! üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª

#### 1. **Optimize image size and slim down images**

Images are undoubtedly the "big guys" of web page loading, and they take up most of the time for page loading! If you can compress the image size, the loading speed will be much faster. You can use some tools (such as **TinyPNG** or **ImageOptim**) to compress images, reduce file size, and maintain high-definition display. Remember, high-definition and fast are not necessarily enemies!

- **Change your perspective**: upload high-definition images to the cloud (such as **Cloudinary**), and automatically adjust the image resolution according to different devices! In this way, the images on the mobile phone will not take up the volume of the computer monitor, avoiding "weight imbalance".
- **Be lazy**: Don't want to process images? Use the lazy image format **WebP**! It can reduce the file size of images while maintaining high quality.

#### 2. **Compress CSS and JavaScript files to make them slimmer! **

CSS and JavaScript files are like the internal organs of a web page. They determine the appearance and functionality of the web page. However, if these files are not compressed, they will be like cookie crumbs in the stomach, scattered all over the floor, taking up your precious loading time.

- **Compress CSS and JavaScript**: Use tools (such as **UglifyJS**, **CSSNano**) to compress JavaScript and CSS files, remove unnecessary spaces, line breaks and comments, make the files compact, and reduce loading time! Imagine changing a fat T-shirt into a fitted tights - compact, neat, and can be put on in minutes!

- **Merge files**: If you have multiple CSS or JavaScript files, try to merge them into one file to reduce the number of server requests, just like moving a house and reducing the number of packages to move! Reducing one package means one less "blocking point", and the website will naturally be fast.

#### 3. **Avoid loading unnecessary resources and clean up "junk"**

Just like tidying up your room, you also need to clean up the "junk" resources when loading a page! You may have some unnecessary plugins, third-party scripts, or style files that you don't need at all. Loading them will only slow down the page.

- **Delayed loading**: Use **Lazy loading** technology to delay the loading of unnecessary content, such as images at the bottom of the page, so that they are only loaded when the user scrolls to them, so that the page will not appear so "fat" when loading!

- **Remove redundant files**: Remove unnecessary styles and script files from the page, and ensure that each loaded resource actually contributes to the page. Imagine that you take all the unnecessary magazines out of your backpack, and the backpack instantly becomes much lighter!

#### 4. **Turn on browser cache, and the page will no longer need to be loaded repeatedly**

Browser cache is like a "memory tag" for a web page. When loading for the first time, the browser will save the static files of the page (such as images, CSS and JavaScript) locally. The next time you visit, the browser will directly read the files from the local, skip the network request, and speed up the loading. Imagine that you don't have to flip through the cards in your wallet every time - they are all remembered!

#### 5. **Use content distribution network (CDN) to speed up resource loading**

Some resources are too large and load slowly on your own server. What should I do? At this time, you can use **CDN (content distribution network)**! Distribute resources to multiple server nodes around the world, allowing users to obtain resources nearby, reduce latency, and increase loading speed. CDN is like a logistics company that distributes express delivery, always delivering packages directly to your door, saving you the trouble of running to the express station to pick up the package!

#### 6. **Use HTTP/2 to improve transmission efficiency**

Some old HTTP protocols are like express companies wrapping each package in a carton, wasting a lot of resources. The modern **HTTP/2** is like a more efficient transportation method. It can send multiple requests in parallel, reducing the latency of page loading. Upgrading to HTTP/2 can bring your website's transmission efficiency to a new level! Equip your server with a "modern courier" and your website will be fast.

#### 7. **Use asynchronous loading of resources**

Modern web pages have many requests, and sometimes you feel like an overburdened postman, running around with too many packages. Through **asynchronous loading**, your website can load important resources first, and then load other non-core content. Just like when you get a package, take out the urgently needed things first, and look at the others later! This will give the user experience a better experience and the page loading will proceed smoothly.

### Quick summary - slim down the web page and run faster!

Don't let slow page loading become your development bottleneck, come and practice these optimization techniques to "slim down" your web page:

- **Compress images** to make the images "light" and fly!

- **Compress CSS and JavaScript** files to reduce unnecessary fat!

- **Remove redundant resources** to make the page more concise!

- **Turn on caching** to let the browser remember you!
- **Use CDN** to speed up resource transmission!
- **Use HTTP/2** to improve transmission efficiency!
- **Asynchronous loading** makes your website smarter!

With these methods, your web pages can load as fast as a sports car, and users will no longer have to wait. Remember, improving web page performance is like fitness, you can't just do it once, you need continuous efforts! Make your web pages more "slim" and exciting, come and join the weight loss army of web page optimization! üí™üåê
