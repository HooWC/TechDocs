Behavioral interviews typically focus on a candidate's past behaviors and experiences to predict how they will perform in a future work environment. These questions are not just about skills, but about soft skills such as attitude, emotion management, and interpersonal skills. Here are some examples of common behavioral interview questions and how to prepare detailed answers.

### 1. What are your strengths?

**Answer example**: "My main strengths are teamwork and problem solving. In the past, I often played the role of a bridge in the team to ensure that all parties can reach a consensus. In my last project, we faced a technical problem and the project progress was stagnant. I organized a group discussion, listened to everyone's ideas, and finally found a compromise solution to ensure that the project was completed on time. I think this teamwork experience will help me better cooperate with team members in this job."

**Preparation points**:

- List 3-5 of your most outstanding strengths and support them with specific examples.

**Purpose**: To assess the candidate's ability to deal with pressure and solve problems.

**Answer example**: "In my last job, we faced an urgent project that the client required to be completed within two weeks. However, the team's resources were limited and the time was very tight. In order to complete the task, I took the initiative to propose a division of labor plan and detailed each link of the project to ensure that everyone was clear about their responsibilities. I also held short meetings every day to track progress and ensure that problems could be solved in a timely manner. In the end, we completed the project within the client's expected time and received good reviews from the client."

**Purpose**: To examine how candidates manage themselves in a high-pressure environment and whether they have the ability to withstand pressure.

**Answer example**: "I think stress is part of the job, the key is how to manage and resolve it. I usually prioritize when I have a lot of work to do and focus on completing the most important tasks. In addition, I will use my breaks to relax for a short time, such as taking a walk or doing some meditation to adjust my mood. I find that this method allows me to stay calm and improve efficiency under high pressure. In the last quarter, my team experienced a peak in business volume. With this method, I not only completed my personal tasks, but also helped the team meet the standards smoothly."

We presented our ideas to the team and objectively discussed the pros and cons of the solutions. In the end, we decided to combine the advantages of both and adopt a compromise solution. I think the most important thing in communication is to respect and listen to others' opinions and find a solution that both parties agree on."
