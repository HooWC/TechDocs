# Hello ðŸ‘‹, I am HOO.

- My name is simple and easy to remember; the key is that I have gotten used to being called HOO by others.
- I am a full-stack engineer from Penang, Malaysia.
- I once crazily worked and self-studied coding for six months, ultimately deciding to pursue a degree in Software Engineering as an ordinary person.
- I once aspired to always be the top performer during school project presentations, like an ordinary person.
- I have developed various types of websites using ASP.NET MVC, determined to become an all-knowing and versatile full-stack engineer.
- I possess strong problem-solving abilities and a high level of self-discipline for self-learning.
- I am a perfectionist when it comes to website design, seeking beauty and the ability to amaze others.
- I prefer back-end development.
- I enjoy learning new programming languages and documenting my notes for future reference.



### My Life (3 years as an Electrical Engineering Technician + 6 months as a Full Stack Intern)

After graduating from high school, I immediately started working as an electrical engineering technician instead of continuing to university. At that time, I believed I could earn money, but over time, I began to regret this decision. During those three years of work, I constantly faced ridicule and reprimands from my boss, which significantly diminished my self-confidence and often left me questioning my worth.

Depression set in. Every night, I felt helpless in a dark room, often having thoughts of ending my life, yet lacking the courage to follow through. While seeking new job opportunities, I applied for administrative positions, but due to my poor high school grades, I received no responses, which left me feeling desperate.

However, I did not give up. I continued searching for opportunities and eventually came across programmers and HTML-related content on a Taiwanese forum. Out of curiosity, I began self-learning on beginner tutorials. Gradually, I started learning programming during breaks at work and in the evenings. With the outbreak of the pandemic and the ongoing work pressure, life felt incredibly bleak, and feelings of collapse and despair returned. Despite urges to run away from home, I gave up on that idea after my familyâ€™s persuasion.

I locked myself in my room, covered my bed with curtains, and immersed myself in darkness, almost learning programming day and night. I learned everything from the basics of HTML to back-end development through platforms like YouTube and Bilibili, documenting hundreds of A4 pages while simulating code and successfully launching my first website. I later explored SQL, C#, and Java, but there were scarce resources for advanced content. Thus, I resolved to return to school to pursue a higher degree.

At 22, I decided to enroll in a Software Engineering program. I spent some time searching for a suitable school and ultimately chose one in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's capital, coinciding with the pandemic making online classes possible, allowing me to avoid relocating.

During my time at school, I worked hard, cherished every learning opportunity, and strived to perfect each project, aiming for high scores in every exam. I constantly reminded myself that this was my only way out. Although I was older than most of my classmates, this motivated me to surpass them.

In the end, I achieved excellent results in every exam, most of them exceeding 90%. Perhaps I regained my confidence; this experience allowed me to achieve self-redemption.
> Even when darkness looms, I still believe that light will return.



### Hobbies and Interests

- **Horror Movies** I enjoy watching horror movies and bloody films because they help me release stress from life.

- **Songwriting** I publish my songs on YouTube, using AI to generate music. I am Muyi æœ¨å·². Despite facing ridicule from many people, I wonâ€™t give up because writing lyrics is a way for me to express my emotions, helping me escape loneliness.

- **Programming Development** I love turning my ideas into a website.

- **Listening to Musi**c I enjoy a variety of music and love listening to rock songs while coding.

- **Writing Novels** I have published eight novels online, enjoying the creation of plots and storylines.


> As long as there is life, one should keep trying.



### Skills I Have Mastered:

- Developing web pages using ASP.NET MVC (as long as you understand the MVC framework, you can develop any type of website; I achieved my small goal of creating a movie site).
- Xamarin + MVVM for app development (however, Microsoft decided to abandon Xamarin in April 2024, recommending us to use the new .NET MAUI).
- Full-stack web development.
- Data analysis using Excel (implemented using Python).
- Laravel + Vue (also for developing web pages and REST APIs).
- Creating REST APIs (using ASP.NET).
- Java Dynamic Web (this MVC framework is quite similar to C# MVC).
- React Native (I can handle simple designs).
