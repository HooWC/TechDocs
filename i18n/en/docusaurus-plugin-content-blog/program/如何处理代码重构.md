Code refactoring is the growth path of every programmer, especially when facing their own "masterpiece", refactoring is a journey from "Oh my God, how could I write such a code" to "Hey! It's actually quite elegant!" This article will explain in detail how to refactor the messy code to be concise and clear, while keeping you happy and funny in the process.

# How to deal with code refactoring: from chaos to simplicity

::: success Tip

Do you feel dizzy when looking at the code you wrote, and secretly swear in your heart "Who am I? Where am I? What did I write?" Congratulations, it's time to refactor the code!

Code refactoring is the growth path of every programmer, especially when facing their own "masterpiece", refactoring is a journey from "Oh my God, how could I write such a code" to "Hey! It's actually quite elegant!" This article will explain in detail how to refactor the messy code to be concise and clear, while keeping you happy in the process.

------

## 1. Necessity of refactoring: Why torture yourself?

Before we get into the actual operation, we need to ask ourselves a question: **Is refactoring really worth it? **Of course! Refactoring is the key to making code more readable, efficient, and easier to maintain. Here are a few signs that tell you that "refactoring" is knocking on the door:

- **Code reads like a tongue twister**: The function you wrote is so deep that you can get lost.

- **The same function appears multiple times**: Yes, you have copied and pasted the same code in several files.

- **Debugging makes you cry**: Even with the help of IDE, you can't tell where the function is called.

- **The code has more comments than the code**: If you need a long comment to explain the purpose of the code, maybe the code itself should be improved.

Now, with these signs, we can start our refactoring journey!

------

## 2. Preparation: If you want to refactor, don't rush to delete the code!

The preparation before refactoring is the same as sharpening the knife before cutting wood. Here are some preparations to make the refactoring process smooth and even a little fun:

- **Write good unit tests**: The first step of refactoring is not to delete code, but to make sure that no matter how you adjust the code, the core functionality remains unchanged. Unit tests are your babysitter.

- **Confirm the logic of the current code**: Don't skip the step of understanding the logic of the code, otherwise you will get lost in the pit of "re-cooking noodles".

- **Backup, backup, backup! **: There is nothing more frustrating in refactoring than "Ah, the code I deleted turned out to be useful!". More Git commits will not make it overheat.

------

## 3. Refactoring process: 5 steps from chaos to clarity

### Step 1: Extract functions - Small functions make life better

:::success Previous article

"Big function? Who wrote it? I don't know!"

:::

First, split the large and complicated function into multiple small functions, and remember that small functions are your friends. Each small function should only handle one thing, keeping the code logic clear. Suppose you have a "nightmare" function like this:

```js
function processOrder(order) {
    validateOrder(order);
    applyDiscount(order);
    calculateShipping(order);
    generateInvoice(order);
    sendEmail(order);
}
```

You can refactor like this:

```js
function processOrder(order) {
    validateOrder(order);
    applyDiscount(order);
    calculateShipping(order);
    generateInvoice(order);
    sendOrderEmail(order); // Extract specific email operations
}
```

Not only is it clear, but it also avoids the embarrassment of "Sorry, I don't understand what I wrote."

------

### Step 2: Delete duplicate code - Repeaters are not friends of programming

:::success Previous article

"Duplicate code is a virus, destroy it!"

:::

If you find yourself writing similar code in different places, it's a good opportunity to refactor. Duplicate code not only wastes time, but also increases the risk of errors. For example:

```js
function calculatePrice(price, discount) {
    return price - price * discount;
}

function calculateFinalPrice(price, discount) {
    return price - price * discount;
}
```

You can write:

```js
function applyDiscount(price, discount) {
    return price - price * discount;
}
```

This not only reduces the amount of code, but also makes later maintenance much easier.

------

### Step 3: Rename variables - let the variables speak for themselves

:::success Previous

"Names like myFunction and myVar are confusing."

:::

Don't be stingy about giving your variables meaningful names! Clear naming is the key to making your code clear at a glance. Instead of calling it `x` or `temp`, it's better to call it `orderTotal` or `discountedPrice`. For example:
```js
let x = 10; 
let y = x * 0.15;
```

to:

```js
let orderTotal = 10;
let discountedTotal = orderTotal * 0.15;
```

The clarity of the code is immediately improved!

------

### Step 4: Reduce nesting - Don't let the code become a Russian nesting doll

:::success Previous article

"I will feel dizzy if there are more than three levels of nesting!"

:::

Too much nesting makes the code difficult to understand. A simple refactoring method is to **return early**. For example:

```js
function processUser(user) {
    if (user) {
        if (user.isActive) {
            if (user.hasValidSubscription) {
                // Handling Users
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Refactored to:

```js
function processUser(user) {
    if (!user || !user.isActive || !user.hasValidSubscription) return;
    // Handling Users
}
```

Not only are there fewer brackets, but the code logic is also clearer.

------

### Step 5: Follow the Single Responsibility Principle - Let the function no longer shoulder multiple tasks

:::success Previous article

"A function only does one thing!"

:::

The single responsibility principle is an important principle for refactoring. Don't let a function be responsible for verification, calculation, and sending emails at the same time, it may be overwhelmed. For example:

```js
function completeOrder(order) {
    validateOrder(order);
    calculateTotal(order);
    sendEmail(order);
}
```

Refactored to:

```js
function completeOrder(order) {
    validateOrder(order);
    calculateTotal(order);
    notifyUser(order); // Separate notifications
}
```

Each function does only one thing, which makes maintenance easier.

------

## 4. Refactoring mentality: embrace change and enjoy the process

The road to refactoring is long, but maintaining a positive and funny mentality can make it a lot easier. Don't make dirty jokes about your previous code, but enjoy the feeling of "self-improvement"! The process of refactoring is the process of continuous learning and improving code quality. Through continuous refactoring, you will find that your code gradually becomes elegant and concise, and even begin to feel proud of your code.

------

## 5. Final advice: Don't be afraid of refactoring, embrace clean code

Code refactoring is not a one-time thing. After writing the code, check and adjust it frequently to ensure that it remains concise and clear. After all, refactoring is the process of transforming your code from chaos to simplicity. With the increase of experience, you will find that refactoring has become an instinct, and concise and clear code will become your contribution to the art of programming!

------

> **Summary**: Refactoring makes your code go from "I dare not look at it again" to "as concise as a work of art"! I hope you can find fun in this process and write more and more elegant code!
