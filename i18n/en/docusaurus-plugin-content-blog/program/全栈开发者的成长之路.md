### The growth path of a full-stack developer: detailed learning routes and key skills

On the road to becoming a full-stack developer, skill improvement and actual project practice at different stages are crucial. Full-stack development means being able to master the ability to develop a complete application from the front-end to the back-end, to database management and API interface development. This blog will take you to an in-depth understanding of the growth path, essential skills and practical learning methods of full-stack development.

------

### 1. Start with the front-end: Lay a solid foundation

**Why start with the front-end? **
Front-end development is the interface where users interact directly with the application. Learning the front-end can more intuitively see the results and feedback. Front-end development can help us quickly build page structures and better understand client needs. It is recommended that beginners start with the front-end first, and then learn back-end development after mastering the basics.

#### 1.1 HTML and CSS: Page structure and style

**Learning objectives:**

- **HTML** is the skeleton of the page, used to build the structure of the web page.

- **CSS** is used to beautify the page and make it attractive.

**Recommended learning content:**

- Learn the basic concepts of HTML tags, elements, and attributes.
- Learn CSS selectors, attributes, and layouts, including Flexbox and Grid.
- Master responsive design to adapt pages to different screen sizes.

#### 1.2 JavaScript: Give pages interactivity

**Learning objectives:**

- JavaScript is a scripting language that enables pages to have dynamic behavior.

**Recommended learning content:**

- Understand the basic syntax of JavaScript, including variables, conditional judgments, loops, etc.
- Master DOM operations to enable dynamic changes to page content.

- Familiar with event handling, and learn to implement interactions such as button clicks and form submissions.

#### 1.3 Front-end framework: Improve development efficiency

**Learning objectives:**

- Front-end frameworks can improve development efficiency, simplify code management, and make code more maintainable.

**Recommended learning content:**

- **React**: A popular front-end framework with component-based thinking and a powerful ecosystem.
- **Vue**: A lightweight framework suitable for beginners, with simple syntax and easy to use.

After mastering the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, choose a framework to study in depth, master concepts such as component development and state management, and lay a solid foundation for subsequent front-end project development.

------

### 2. Back-end Getting Started: An Introduction to Python

**Why Choose Python? **
Python is simple and easy to learn, with intuitive syntax and rich library and framework support, making it suitable as an entry-level language for back-end.

#### 2.1 Basic Python: Understand core concepts

**Learning objectives:**

- Be familiar with Python's basic syntax and data types, including strings, lists, dictionaries, etc.

- Master object-oriented programming (OOP) ideas, such as classes and objects.

**Recommended learning content:**

- Be familiar with the use of functions, classes, and modules, and understand the exception handling mechanism.

- Learn file operations and learn to read and write file contents.

#### 2.2 Flask and Django: Backend Framework

**Learning Objectives:**

- Learn to use the framework to build a server and implement basic front-end and back-end interactions.

**Recommended Learning Content:**

- **Flask**: A lightweight framework suitable for beginners to build simple applications.

- **Django**: A full-featured framework that provides more built-in functions and is suitable for building complex projects.

It is recommended to start with Flask to understand basic HTTP requests, routing settings, etc.; then you can turn to Django to learn more complex backend management systems, user authentication and other functions.

#### 2.3 RESTful API: A bridge for front-end and back-end data interaction

**Learning Objectives:**

- RESTful API is a standard interface that facilitates front-end and back-end communication.

**Recommended Learning Content:**

- Master the basic principles of RESTful API, including GET, POST, PUT, DELETE and other requests.

- Use Flask or Django to build a simple API interface to implement data addition, deletion, modification and query operations.

------

### 3. Database management: Learn data storage and query

Database is an indispensable part of full-stack development. Mastering the use of database can provide persistent data storage for applications.

#### 3.1 SQL database: data storage and management

**Learning objectives:**

- Learn to use SQL databases, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, and understand the design and operation of data tables.

**Recommended learning content:**

- Learn SQL basics, including commands such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

- Master basic table association operations, such as JOIN, subqueries, etc.

- Learn to design relational databases and master knowledge such as foreign keys, indexes, and constraints.

#### 3.2 ORM: Simplify database operations

In back-end development, it may be complicated to operate the database directly using SQL. Python provides ORM (object-relational mapping) tools, such as SQLAlchemy (Flask) and Django ORM, which can simplify database operations.

**Learning content:**

- Use ORM instead of traditional SQL queries to encapsulate database operations into object operations, which is more intuitive and easy to understand.

------

### 4. Full stack advanced: Integrate front-end and back-end with API interface

After mastering front-end and back-end development and database management, the next step is to integrate these contents together to develop a fully functional application.

#### 4.1 Front-end and back-end separation

In the front-end and back-end separation mode, the front-end application (React or Vue) and the back-end server (Flask or Django) communicate through the API.

**Learning content:**

- The front-end sends requests through AJAX, Fetch API or Axios to interact with the back-end data.

- The back-end provides data services through the RESTful API interface and returns data in JSON format.

#### 4.2 User authentication and authorization

Security is a very important part of full stack development. Learning how to implement user authentication and authorization in the project can make the application more secure.

**Learning content:**

- Implement user registration, login, and logout functions, and use encrypted methods to store passwords.

- Master token-based authentication methods (such as JWT) to improve application security.

------

### 5. Deployment and operation and maintenance: project launch

The completed project needs to be deployed online. Learning deployment skills allows you to publish local projects to the Internet for easy user access.

#### 5.1 Deployment tools and platforms

**Learning objectives:**

- Understand the use of deployment platforms and tools, such as AWS, DigitalOcean, Heroku, etc.

**Recommended learning content:**

- Learn to configure the environment on the cloud server and install the required dependency packages.

- Learn to use Docker containerized applications to facilitate project operation in different environments.

#### 5.2 CI/CD automated deployment

**Learning objectives:**

- CI/CD (continuous integration and continuous deployment) tools can help automate testing and deployment processes and save development time.

**Recommended learning content:**

- Use tools such as GitHub Actions, GitLab CI or Jenkins to configure automated deployment processes to ensure that each code update can be automatically tested and deployed.

------

### 6. Practical projects: improve practical experience

Theoretical learning is important, but practical project development is the key to improving full-stack capabilities. The following are some recommended practical projects:

1. **Personal blog system**: including user registration, article management, comment functions, etc.

2. **E-commerce website**: realize product display, shopping cart, order, payment and other functions.

3. **To-do application**: includes user login, task addition, editing and deletion functions.

4. **Chat room application**: realize user real-time chat function, using WebSocket or Socket.io technology.

Each project is a complete full-stack application that can help you get practical training in front-end and back-end development, database management, API interface design, etc.
